# Algorithms-and-Datastructures
This repository compiles essential coding patterns that will help you master algorithms and data structures for technical interviews.

## 1. Learn the Fundamentals

Before jumping into problem solving, build a strong foundation in: 

- Time and Space Complexity (Big O)
- Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues
- Trees, Graphs, HashMap, Heaps
- Recursion and Dynamic Programming

## 2. Master the Core Patterns (Instead of Solving 500+ Questions)

Instead of grinding random problems, focus on these 14 must know patterns:

- Sliding Window
- Two Pointers
- Fast & Slow Pointers
- Merge Intervals
- Cyclic Sort
- Topological Sorting
- Subsets (Backtracking)
- Two Heaps
- Binary Search
- BFS/DFS
- Dynamic Programming
- Trie & String Manipulation
- Graph Traversal
- Bit Manipulation

## 3-Step Problem Solving Framework

Step 1: Understand the Problem Deeply 

- Rephrase the problem in your own words.
- Identify constraints and edge cases.

Step 2: Identify the  Pattern & Plan a Solution

- Recognize which DSA technique applies
- Start with a brute-force approach, then optimize.

Step 3: Implement & Debug Like Pro

- write clean, modular code with proper variable names.
- Dry run with test cases before submitting.

## 4- Be Consistent: The 2-Hour Rule

- Daily Routine (2 Hours/Day):
- 30 min - Review a concept/pattern
- 60 min - Solve 2-3 problems (easy → medium → hard).
- 30 min - Revisit mistakes & optimize solutions.

## 5 - Mock Interviews: The Game Changer

- Do mock interviews with peers or on platforms
- Think out loud explain your approach before coding
- After every session, analyze what went well & what to improve.

When practicing algorithms and data structures, looking up the answer isn’t the problem. The problem is if you don’t use the answer to learn. 

Most people just read the answer, analyze it to understand it, and then move on without even **re-implementing it**. 

Knowing how the solution works doesn’t help as much as learning why the solution works.

- When you find a solution, think about  about why it works the way it does.
- The best way to learn from a solution you look up is to read it for a very short period of time to understand the general concept, then go back and try to solve the problem again without looking at the solution. As you re-implement the solution without looking at it, you’re going to be thinking about the logical reason for why the solution is implemented that way rather than trying to remember what the solution was.
- If during practice you get stuck trying to remember how a particular part of a solution was implemented, this is where  you should be able to slow down and logically think through the options. Since you already know the options or have a good idea of the concept, it’s much different from being stuck in the beginning with no knowledge of any solution. Getting stuck on which way the solution works is good because it gives you time to truly understand why to choose which way.
- The next step which almost guarantees you’ll retain it, is to find more problems that can be solved in similar ways and apply the solution. Seeing it being used in different contexts helps a lot with understanding because it exposes the core of the solution aside from the specific details of the question.
